Another useful example is defining shared customized styles for certain variants of an element. This allows the customization of whole trees of components without having to repeat any styles. The following example demonstrates cascading even better than the previous one. It also introduces the idea of sharing styles between different elements:

```css
.btn {
  --bg-color: #002299;
  --text-color: #fff;
  --highlight-color: #669900;

  background-color: var(--bg-color);
  color: var(--text-color);
}
/* --highlight-color is also available to the children of .btn */
.btn .highlight {
  color: var(--highlight-color);
}
/* .btn.danger .highlight will use the --highlight-color defined in .btn-danger */
.btn-danger {
  --bg-color: #dd4a68;
  --text-color: #000;
  --highlight-color: #990055;
}
```
